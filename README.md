1. Data sources that were used and will be using:
     1) The data that was scraped from a Chinese recruitment website
     2) Dataset from LinkedIn and Google jobs
2. Goals of analysis
   Positions at tech companies have become the top choice for young people when they look for jobs. By analyzing data from major recruitment websites, the project aims to present the distribution of job opportunities at 50 major cities in China and  the USA. The project will also provide information on certain job requirements like experience level and the salary range accordingly. To achieve the goals, I will use MySQL to do data cleaning and use Python to do the calculations.
3. Deliverable:
   An html that is ready for job hunters to use.
   Through the html, job seekers in tech industry can find out which area has the most opportunities for the position they want.
   It will also function as a search engine on which users can choose two from "Location", "Salary Range", "Working Experience", "Job Description" and "Benefits" and input their preference for these two, then get an idea what choices they will have on current job market.
   It will also be a handy tool for investors since they can get the latest development trend of the industry.
